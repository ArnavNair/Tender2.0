This folder consists of python notebooks required to pick the best bid among all the bidders with respect to a particular sector of the government.

This is implemented using WordtoVector conversion of each bidder's proposal, and then find the proposal which comes the closest to perfectly meeting the requirements.

The bid is then selected using the tender-blockchain part of this project.
